1.2 - Coding with Conditionals

Learning Goals:
1.  Using comparison operators to compare variables, strings, and numbers
2.Write and understand conditional logic

//
//
//Code-a-long: Comparision Operator

//1. Write at least 2 expressions using the "less than" operator


//2. Write at least 2 expressions using the "greater than" operator


//3. Write at least 2 expressions using the "less than or equal to" operator


//4. Write at least 2 expressions using the "greater than or equal to" operator.


//5. Write at least 2 expressions using the "equivalent" operator.


//6. Write at least 2 expressions using the  "not equal" operator.


//
//
//Code-a-long:  Using Comparison Operators to Evaluate Variables.

//
//Declaring the variable "language" and assinging a value


//1. Write 2 conditions involving the variable "language" that evaluates to false


//2. Write 2 conditions involving the variable "language" that evaluates to true


//
//Declaring the variables "year" and "nextYear" and assigning a value


//3. Write 2 conditions involving the variable "year" and the "greater than" operator that evaluates to true


//4. Write 2 conditions involving the variable "year" and the "not equal" operator that evaluates to true


//5. Write a condition involving the variable "year", the variable "nextYear" the "less than" operator that evaluates to true


//
//
//Try It:  Using Comparision Oprerators

//
//Declaring the variables "firstName" and "age" and assigning them a value.


//Check the appropriate variables for the following things:
//a. Is your name the same as "Karlie"?


//b. Is your age the same as 15?


//c. Is your age not the same as 15?


//d. Is your age greater than 7?


//e. Is your age less than or equal to 10?


//g. What is the remainder when you age is divided by 2?  (Helpful Hint:  Look up an operator called modulo)


//
//Challenge:  Have you ever tried to create a password, but the application told you you need at least 8 characters? Time to solve a real-world challenge!
// Declare the variable "fakePassword" and assign it a string of your choice.


//Use Google to look up a way to check the number of characters for the value stored in fakePassword



//
//
//Code-a-long:  If Statements
//Directions: Describe the function or purpose of each line of the if statement

var dogAge = 15;

if dogAge < 2 {
  print("You are a puppy")
}
else if dogAge > 12 {
  print("You are awesome")
}
else {
  print("You are old")
}

//Try It: Conditionals
